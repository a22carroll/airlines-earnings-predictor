AIRLINE EARNINGS PREDICTION PROJECT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=====================================================
Generated: September 25, 2025

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Best Model: Linear Regression
- Accuracy: 95.8% (R² Score)
- Average Error: $163M per prediction
- Data Sources: TSA passenger data, airline operations, economic indicators

Q2 2025 REVENUE PREDICTIONS:
- Total Industry Revenue: $52,984M
- Average Revenue Change: +13.9% vs latest quarter

AIRLINE-SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS:
- AAL: $14,693M (+17.1% change)
- DAL: $16,047M (+14.3% change)
- LUV: $7,022M (+9.2% change)
- UAL: $15,222M (+15.2% change)

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Operating expenses and passenger revenue are strongest predictors
- TSA passenger data provides early indicator of airline performance  
- Model successfully captures seasonal and operational variations
- Economic factors (oil prices, consumer confidence) provide additional context

DATA SOURCES:
- TSA checkpoint throughput data (alternative data advantage)
- Airline quarterly financial reports (fundamental analysis)
- Federal Reserve economic indicators (macro environment)
- 6 quarters of data across 4 major airlines

METHODOLOGY:
- Time series split for realistic prediction testing
- Feature engineering to align different data frequencies
- Cross-validation to assess model stability
- Focus on interpretable linear model for business insights

LIMITATIONS:
- Small dataset (24 observations) limits model complexity
- Predictions assume current economic/operational trends continue
- Model performance may vary with major industry disruptions

RECOMMENDED USAGE:
- Use as starting point for quarterly revenue forecasting
- Combine with qualitative business judgment
- Update model as new data becomes available
- Monitor actual vs predicted performance for model refinement
